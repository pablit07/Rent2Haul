                                              Hiring a professional mover delivers exceptional value on a day that can be otherwise very stressful. Moving can be both emotionally and physically draining, and handling delicate or bulky items with care requires specific moving skills. We highly recommend turning to professionals for this, as you would for many of your households needs such as plumbing and electricity.

With 30 years of experience in local moving and long distance moving, our teams of highly trained movers can tackle moves of any size or complexity. We treat every move with the personal care that you would expect from friends and family. However, unlike friends and family, we guarantee satisfaction.

                                             We base an estimate for a local move on an hourly rate, which includes the drive time for each leg of the move: from the moving company to your original home, then to your destination, and back again to the moving company.

Pricing for a long distance move is based on a flat rate, fixed price. Once we have taken an inventory of your furniture and other belongings, and identified a timeframe for delivery, we are happy to provide a binding price for your move. If you prefer, we can also price a long distance move by weight.
<br> A 50% non refundable deposit is required at time of booking a move. This is to ensure your spot is held which allows us to schedule the appropriate equipment and resources for the move.

                                            Moving labor represents the majority of the moving expense. However, you should also budget for packing supplies, such as moving boxes and tape, and for additional valuation (moving insurance) as needed. Ufirst Moving takes special precautions with delicate or oversized items, such as flat screen televisions and chandeliers. These items often require a custom wooden crate, which will incur an additional fee.

                                             As with other service industries, you may wish to thank your movers for a job well done by offering a gratuity. While the movers do not expect a set amount, we suggest a tip based on your satisfaction with your crew and the overall move; with a broad guideline of $4-6 per man, per hour. If you feel that your movers went above and beyond in their efforts, you may want to increase the amount accordingly.

We are able to offer valuation (moving insurance) to our customers at a very fair price due to the very low number of claims we file.

                                             We recommend scheduling your move as far in advance as you can. The farther out you can plan your move, the greater the availability you will have in choosing a date and time that is convenient for you. A general rule of thumb is to contact us no later than two weeks in advance of your desired move date. We realize advance planning is not always possible, and do our best to accommodate last minute customers as well.

                                             Because complex events, such as a home closure or completion of construction, can be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances, we don't recommend scheduling your move for the same day. Save yourself the stress of rescheduling and plan your move date for several days after your closing date.

<br>Demand for moving services is generally at its lowest during the middle of the month and, in particular, the middle of the week. If your schedule allows for a move on one of these days, Movers often offer their most competitive rates during those times.

He/she can work with you to make the best possible "plan b" for packing. This may mean having the movers finish your packing or, if you have the flexibility and we have the availability, pushing back your moving day in order to allow more time to pack. If you have a only a small quantity of items left to pack, your movers can often complete this on moving day; however, it is important to understand that this will add time to the job and, therefore, add to the total cost of the move.

                                             No. We are not equipped to dispose of trash. However, if you wish to have something transported to a waste disposal location, we are able to transport it at the hourly rate plus any fee imposed by the disposal facility. If possible, talk to your move coordinator prior to moving day to make these arrangements.

                                             Yes. Our professional movers and moving trucks are prepared to move during rain, sleet, or snow. They come equipped with supplies to keep your belongings safe from the elements. However, in order to keep costs down, we recommend that you shovel, rake, or otherwise clear the access ways in preparation for their arrival.
